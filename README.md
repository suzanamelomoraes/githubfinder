# GitHub Finder

Application that allows the user to search for GitHub profiles and visualise their details such as name, company name, repositories, followers and so on.

The user can also access not only the GitHub user's profile by link but also the latest five repositories published by those GitHub users.

The goal of this project is to practice writing APIs with fetch and using async functions to consume external APIs, such as GitHub.

This application is one of the projects developed in the course Modern JavaScript from the Beginning by Udemy/Brad Traversy.
